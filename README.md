Welcome to my Website! The link above is where you can access it.

I applied my knowledge of HMTL/CSS, Javascript and BootStrap to get my personal website up and running.

I had fun implementing ways to make it more interactive such as having the typing animation and the visiter counter using CountAPI

All icons were grabbed from FontAwesome!
